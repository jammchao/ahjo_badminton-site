    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I’m Joe, better known as AhJo Badminton, a passionate Malaysian badminton superfan and cheerleader. My mission is to create an electrifying atmosphere for our national badminton players, ensuring they feel the unwavering support of Malaysian fans—no matter where they compete.</p>
    <p>Badminton has long been a source of national pride for Malaysia, with our athletes consistently ranking among the world’s best. However, on the global stage, they often find themselves in arenas where Malaysian voices are outnumbered. To bridge this gap, I am working to establish an official Malaysian badminton support and cheerleading team. This initiative will not only boost our players’ morale but also strengthen our nation’s badminton culture worldwide.</p>

    <h2>My Journey – Fueled by Love and Sacrifice</h2>
    <p>From the roars at Thailand Open to the tears at Malaysia Masters, the chants in Singapore, and the energy in Indonesia, I was there—not as a player or VIP, but as a fan with a heart full of hope.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Cheered through pain, lost my voice, cried during the anthem, and smiled through defeat.</li>
      <li>Hugged strangers who became family and stood under flags that waved with pride.</li>
      <li>All because I believe in Malaysia. Always.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>My Journey (2024 - 2025)</h2>
    <p>I actively attend major international badminton tournaments to support our players. Below are some of the key events where I’ve cheered for Malaysia:</p>

    </ul>

    </ul>

    <h2>The Vision: Building a Stronger Malaysian Badminton Support System</h2>
    <p>The Malaysian badminton support and cheerleading team is more than just a group of fans—it’s a movement to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Strengthen national pride and unity through badminton</li>
      <li>Ensure our athletes never feel alone, no matter where they compete</li>
      <li>Establish structured, passionate fan support that travels globally</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Let’s Work Together</h2>
    <p>I’m on a mission—and I can’t do it alone. I’m looking for brands, media, and sponsors who believe in more than just winning... who believe in heart, passion, and purpose.</p>
    <p>Let’s raise our voices louder. Let’s show the world the spirit of Malaysia. Together, we don’t just cheer. We make history.</p>
